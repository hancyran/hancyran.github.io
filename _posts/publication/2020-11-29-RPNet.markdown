## Abstraction
The prevalence of relation networks in computer vision is in stark contrast to underexplored point-based methods. 
In this paper, we explore the possibilities of local relation operators and survey their feasibility. 
We propose a scalable and efficient module, called group relation aggregator. 
The module computes a feature of a group based on the aggregation of the features of the inner-group points weighted by geometric relations and semantic relations. 
For convenience, we generalize groupwise operations to assemble this module. 
We adopt this module to design our **RPNet**. We further verify the expandability of RPNet, in terms of both depth and width, on the tasks of classification and segmentation. 
Surprisingly, empirical results show that wider RPNet fits for classification, while deeper RPNet works better on segmentation. 
RPNet achieves state-of-the-art for classification and segmentation on challenging benchmarks. 
We also compare our local aggregator with PointNet++, with around **30%** parameters and **50%** computation saving. 
Finally, we conduct experiments to reveal the robustness of RPNet with regard to rigid transformation and noises.
